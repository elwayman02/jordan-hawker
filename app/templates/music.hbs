        <p class="biography">
            In 2006, DJ Axle (Jordan Hawker) discovered the life-changing experience of Dance. Since then, he has taken
            that passion to the next level by DJing all over the country, including Seattle Fusion Festival, DJX, Austin
            Fusion Party, Austin Blues Party, Bluesalicious, Show-Me Blues and more. Variety is the spice of life, and
            Jordan takes that to heart, pushing the envelope of genres we expect in dance; he particularly enjoys playing
            little-known artists to expand his audience's horizons and expectations. Representing the San Francisco Bay
            Area, DJ Axle's diverse musical style will keep you dancing 'til the lights go out!
