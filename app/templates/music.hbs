<h3>Biography</h3>

    In 2006, DJ Axle (Jordan Hawker) discovered the life-changing experience that is Dance.
    Since then, he has taken that passion to the next level by DJing all over the country,
    including Seattle Fusion Festival, DJX Fusion Weekend, Austin Fusion Party, Austin Blues Party,
    Bluesalicious, Show-Me Blues, and many more.  Variety is the spice of life, and Jordan takes that
    to heart in his music, mixing modern tunes with vintage classics that will get everyone moving!
    He especially enjoys playing songs from regional and little-known artists to introduce his audience
    to music they wouldn't normally hear from other DJs.  Currently representing the San Francisco Bay Area,

    of the Fresh Coast.  His diverse musical style will keep you dancing 'til the lights go out!
